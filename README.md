Dear sir,

I've completed the assigned task for the Frontend Developer position. In this project, I have used React JS, Tailwind CSS, and JavaScript.
Upon form submission, I parsed the JSON data provided in the data folder and displayed it according to the specifications outlined in the image.

To run the project, please follow these steps:

**As this is a react project node js has to be installed on your local machine**

1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Open the code folder in Visual Studio Code
3. Open the root directory in the terminal and install the necessary modules by typing npm i 
4. Then run the project using npm run dev
5. After running the command it will provide a link through which you can check the output  

It took me 3-4 hours to complete the task. The best practices I have used in this project are version controlling, front-end 
framework, component-based architecture, parsing data using Axios and Responsive Design.

These are my best two projects:
